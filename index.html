            <li>Landscape: [competitors, similar products/systems], [The difference between our project and the competitors]</li>
            <p>
                Our team is developing a recipe search engine that aims to provide users with the ability to convert ingredients into complete recipes. 
                In doing so, we have identified a few competitors in the market, including Supercook and MyFridgefood.
                However, we believe that our platform offers several unique features that differentiate us from these competitors, which are: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Missing ingredients shop location:</li>
                <p>
                    While MyFridgeFood and Supercook allow users to search for recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand; 
                    our website takes it a step further by helping users locate and purchase any missing ingredients.
                    This feature makes it easier for users to follow recipes and cook delicious meals, even if they don't have all of the necessary ingredients at home. 
                    Overall, our website provides a convenient and useful tool for users looking to find and purchase missing ingredients for their recipes. 
                </p>
                <li>Recipe substitutions:</li>
                    <p>
                        This feature would enable users to enter an ingredient they don't have and locate substitutes for it. 
                        This may be particularly useful for people who are trying to use up ingredients they currently have on hand or for those who must make substitutions because of dietary requirements.        
                    </p>
                <li>Recipe scaling:</li>
                <p>
                    This feature would allow users to adjust the serving size of a recipe up or down to accommodate their needs. 
                    This could be especially helpful for those who are cooking for a large group or for those who want to make a recipe in bulk to freeze for later.    
                </p>
                <li>Recipe nutrition information:</li>
                <p>
                    This feature would allow users to plan their meals for the week and create a shopping list based on their planned meals. 
                    This could help users save time and money by planning their meals in advance and only buying the ingredients they need. 
                </p>
                <li>Meal planning calendar:</li>
                <p>
                    This would involve integrating the website with smart home devices such as smart ovens and refrigerators. 
                    This could allow users to easily access and follow recipes while cooking and could also enable the website to suggest recipes based on the ingredients detected in the user's smart refrigerator.
                </p>
                <li>Smart home devices integration:</li>
                <p>
                    This feature would create a space for users to connect with each other and share cooking tips, recipe ideas, and more. 
                    This could help users learn from and engage with other home cooks and could also provide a sense of community and support for those who enjoy cooking.
                </p>
                <li>Community forum:</li>
                <p>
                    This feature would allow users to input their dietary preferences and the ingredients they have on hand and receive personalized recipe recommendations based on these inputs. 
                    This could help users discover new recipes they may not have otherwise considered and make meal planning more efficient.
                </p>
                <li>Recipe recommendations:</li>
                <p>
                    This feature would allow users to rate and review recipes that they have tried, which could help other users find the best recipes. 
                    It could also allow users to leave comments or tips about the recipe, which could be helpful for those who are trying the recipe for the first time.
                </p>
                <li>Recipe ratings and reviews:</li>
                <p>
                    This feature would allow users to see the nutritional information for a recipe, including the number of calories, fat, protein, and other nutrients. 
                    This could be helpful for those who are trying to maintain a healthy diet or who have specific dietary needs.
