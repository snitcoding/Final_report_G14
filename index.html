                <p>
                    Tasks <br>
                    Each member was assigned different tasks based on their skills and interests. However, we always encouraged to support each other whenever there was a problem even if it was trivial. By this way, we saved good amount of time and individual efforts so our overall performance and progress could be smooth. <br>
                    Support <br>
                    Members could push the progress. <br>
                    Communication <br>
                    The Leader talks mostly, anytime when there is a problem occurs or meetings. Members were free to raise their voice. <br>
                    Some became more active due to good motivation. <br>
                    Silent people will always be asked to provide responses. If they cannot, they will be asked to give their reasons. <br>
                    Decision making <br>
                    The leader makes decisions after hearing members’ suggestions. But sometimes, members can act on their own if they backup original copies for the leader to review and they already finish their tasks.

                <b>Career Plans</b>
                <p>
                    Tin and Quang have quite similar career plans in the data sector. Tin wants to be an AI engineer, whereas Quang would love to become a data engineer. Meanwhile, Quan’s dream job is still undefined but he would like to learn more about coding so it can be safe to assume that he wants to become a developer. 
                    On the other hand, Vu has determined to pursue the paths of mobile developer or an OS manager. <br>
                    Though our dream jobs vary, the core of these jobs is the in-depth knowledge of how operating systems work and how to translate codes into products. 
                    The main difference among them might be the amount of coding languages required for each job, which caused trivial problems in this project that HTML/CSS is not necessary for data jobs, but it is essential for web and mobile developers. <br>
                    Each members’ career plan is similar from the beginning to junior level where we all want to at least acquire basic principles at junior level. After that, our paths are totally different in terms of professions, but they are similar in job promotion that we all want to become profoundly senior engineers.

                <b>Topic and Motivation</b>
            </li>
            <p>
                Because of Covid-19, the eating habits of many consumers across Asia have entirely changed. According to a Nielsen survey, 86 percent of Chinese chose to cook at home post-pandemic instead of eating out, in Hong Kong, the percentage was 77%, in Vietnam, Malaysia, and South Korea, it was 62%, in Thailand it was 56%, and in Taiwan it was 54%. []. 
                Due to this change, many people have become accustomed to cooking at home. 
                However, there are numerous factors to consider when cooking, such as ingredients, equipment, and recipes, which can be overwhelming and exhausting. 
                Which is why our project is a food website dedicated to making cooking quick and easy called KookASAP! Our platform, also known as "Cook as soon as possible" is here to assist anyone who needs help in the kitchen. Whether you are an inexperienced cook, short on time, easily confused by recipes, looking to try new dishes, or simply unsure of what to make, KookASAP has something for you. With a range of features including a search function, recipe recommendations, step-by-step instructions, and more, we aim to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly tool to help you find and follow recipes and cook delicious meals. 
                We offer a wide selection of recipes catering to various dietary restrictions and preferences, and our platform also includes features such as ingredient substitutes, recipe scaling, and nutritional information to make cooking even easier. 
                Plus, with integration with meal and grocery delivery services, a social aspect for sharing experiences and connecting with other foodies, and more, KookASAP is here to make cooking enjoyable for everyone.

                <b>Landscape</b>
            </li>
            <p>
                Our team is developing a recipe search engine that aims to provide users with the ability to convert ingredients into complete recipes. 
                In doing so, we have identified a few competitors in the market, including Supercook and MyFridgefood.
            </p>
            <img src="image/Picture1.png" alt="" class="center">

            </p>
            <p>
                However, we believe that our platform offers several unique features that differentiate us from these competitors, which are: 
            </p>
            <p>
                - Missing ingredients shop location: While MyFridgeFood and Supercook allow users to search for recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand; 
                our website takes it a step further by helping users locate and purchase any missing ingredients.
                This feature makes it easier for users to follow recipes and cook delicious meals, even if they don't have all of the necessary ingredients at home. 
                Overall, our website provides a convenient and useful tool for users looking to find and purchase missing ingredients for their recipes. 
            </p>
                <p>
                    - Recipe substitutions: This feature would enable users to enter an ingredient they don't have and locate substitutes for it. 
                    This may be particularly useful for people who are trying to use up ingredients they currently have on hand or for those who must make substitutions because of dietary requirements.        
                </p>
            <p>
                - Recipe scaling: This feature would allow users to adjust the serving size of a recipe up or down to accommodate their needs. 
                This could be especially helpful for those who are cooking for a large group or for those who want to make a recipe in bulk to freeze for later.    
            </p>
            <p>
                - Recipe nutrition information: This feature would allow users to plan their meals for the week and create a shopping list based on their planned meals. 
                This could help users save time and money by planning their meals in advance and only buying the ingredients they need. 
            </p>
            <p>
                - Meal planning calendar: This would involve integrating the website with smart home devices such as smart ovens and refrigerators. 
                This could allow users to easily access and follow recipes while cooking and could also enable the website to suggest recipes based on the ingredients detected in the user's smart refrigerator.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Smart home devices integration: This feature would create a space for users to connect with each other and share cooking tips, recipe ideas, and more. 
                This could help users learn from and engage with other home cooks and could also provide a sense of community and support for those who enjoy cooking.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Community forum: This feature would allow users to input their dietary preferences and the ingredients they have on hand and receive personalized recipe recommendations based on these inputs. 
                This could help users discover new recipes they may not have otherwise considered and make meal planning more efficient.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Recipe recommendations: This feature would allow users to rate and review recipes that they have tried, which could help other users find the best recipes. 
                It could also allow users to leave comments or tips about the recipe, which could be helpful for those who are trying the recipe for the first time.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Recipe ratings and reviews: This feature would allow users to see the nutritional information for a recipe, including the number of calories, fat, protein, and other nutrients. 
                This could be helpful for those who are trying to maintain a healthy diet or who have specific dietary needs.

                    Project scope is where we set boundaries in our project and define exactly what goals, deadlines, and project deliverables we will be working towards. It helps us remain focused and on tasks for a better outcome. [] Because of limited time and capabilities, we have narrowed down and limit our scope, but we still keep the core and essential features to be delivered in our proof of concept:

                    <b>Plans and Progress</b>
                    <p>
                        A concrete plan is undeniably important as the starting point of any project. Hence, our team spent a week making a plan that was suitable for individual schedules and personal skills. However, we have learnt that a project's progress would never be proceeded without any mistakes no matter what scale that project might be, so we have prepared for the worst and been ready to tackle any difficulties according to our risk assessment. But then again, there had been many unexpected outcomes that took us days and nights to remediate the plan. This part will display what we have done to follow the proposal and what changes we have made for our website to work properly. <br>

                    <b>Tools and Technology</b>
                    <p>
                        In any project, the tools and technologies used can greatly impact the success and efficiency of the project. Careful selection and use of the right tools and technologies can streamline workflows, improve collaboration, and lead to higher quality results. For KookASAP, our team used the following software and tools:
                        <p>
                            -	HTML for defining the structure and layout of the website. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            -	CSS for styling the page and controlling its layout.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            -	JavaScript for adding interactivity to the page, such as handling the search form submission and modifying the page content based on user actions.
                        </p>
                            

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            -	Github and Github Desktop as well as Git Bash were used for managing and modifying the workflow and project during the development process. <br>
                                These tools were useful in helping to organize and streamline the development process, as they allowed the team to track changes, collaborate, and stay organized as they worked on the project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            -	Photoshop version 23.5.0 was used to design the logo for the project, In order to use Photoshop, a license was required. This allowed the team to legally access and use the software for their project. The use of Photoshop allowed our team to create a high-quality logo that helped to establish the branding and visual identity of the project. 
                        </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The only hardware requirement was a standard laptop or similar devices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regarding prior experience, all group members had experience with Github, Github Desktop and Git Bash. Tin and Quan had experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our member, Tin, only had 1 month experience with Photoshop, so he learned it specifically for this project. Overall, our team was able to utilize our skills and knowledge to successfully complete the project.

                    <p>
                        Testing our website is the crucial step to ensure that the website has no problems before we present it to everyone. Firstly, we accessed the website and logged in with a guest account. After the login was complete, we took a try at identifying ingredients through the search engine on the homepage. When we entered the ingredients that we want to cook with the food, the recommendation showed all French cuisine recipe which includes our chosen ingredients. Unfortunately, the leader of our group recognized a bug in the bookmark extension and reported it to the team. The issue is the users are not able to save their loving recipes and it will take a long time to research them again. We maintenanced the website for a while and fixed the bug. It was not a serious problem, but we will get in trouble with our distinguished guests in the future if they cannot save their own recipes at favorite. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the second testing time, we invited a few students in the school to be users of our website. Our purpose is to know the opinion of other users except the developers. Luckily, we received many positive comments on our project. The users told us that they could access the website immediately without any problems. They were surprised when we told them that the website was hosted on github which solves all issues of internet connection. Finally, thanks to the user's opinion, we are now extremely confident and optimistic when we introduce the project to the class. <br>

                            -	Some special cases with more than 2 ingredients may result in the website returning recipes that are unrelated to the inputted ingredients. For this issue, our development team may need to improve the search algorithm or add additional filters to better match the inputted ingredients to relevant recipes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            -	The website's interface may not look as pleasing on smaller screens or resolutions. To address this, our designing team may need to adjust the layout or design of the website to better adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            -	The recipe APIs database used by the website is limited, which means that the number of available recipes is restricted. Our development team is working on expanding the database and integrating additional APIs or source recipes from other sources.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            -	The recipe pages are still not very detailed and have a limited amount of information available. Additionally, they may not look as clean and polished as desired. To make the recipe pages more detailed and clean-looking, our development team may need to add more information to the pages and improve the design and layout. This could involve adding additional photos, nutritional information, tips, or other details to the pages.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, while the website is functional and can be useful for finding and accessing recipes, it is still in an early stage of development and may have some bugs or limitations. The specific solutions that are implemented will depend on the resources and priorities of the team.

                    <b>Further Improvements</b>
                    <p>
                        There is always room for improvement, and our team is committed to continuously updating and enhancing the website's functionality. Some areas that could potentially be improved upon in the future include expanding the recipe database to include more diverse and international dishes, adding additional features such as a meal planner or shopping list, and integrating with other platforms or apps to provide a more seamless experience for users, etc. The team is also working on improving the website's performance and addressing any remaining bugs or issues that may arise. Overall, there are many ways that the website could be further improved to provide a better experience for users.

                            The task of testing a website's functionality falls on website testers. To imitate actual user behavior, such as moving across multiple sites or interacting with different page elements, they frequently employ several tools and techniques. The task of finding any flaws or problems that are discovered by website testers may also be given to them. This may entail making thorough notes about what occurred and how it occurred so that programmers may subsequently figure out and resolve the issue.
