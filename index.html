                    Short for Friendly and Simple, it is pronounced similarly to the word "fast," which is fitting because our website aims to provide quick results and convenient access to its users. The name FaS captures the essence of what our website strives to achieve: offering a friendly and simple user experience that allows people to find what they are looking for in a fast and efficient manner. We believe that by offering a website that is easy to use and navigate, we can help our users save time and effort in finding the information or resources they need.

                    Quang is interested in database management and cloud computing as the world has been emerging around these concepts. Therefore, his responsibilities are not only as a project coordinator who makes schedules for meetings and deadlines, but also as a data administrator who is in charge of maintaining and improving the integrity and safety of our work. Another task of Quang is to make the final decision so that our milestone should be in line with our scope as well as complying with any relevant standards. <br>
                    In terms of the report, Quang is assigned to write four parts including Team Profile, Plan and Progress, Communications and Risks that he will introduce our group’s members, present our event timelines, and assess possible risks based on potential and severity.

                    After high school graduation, Quan has set his ultimate goal to be a full-stack developer and his first project should be related to a website contributed by his own code. That is why he is our technical guy who will learn from online resources and build a basic website from scratch utilizing HTML and CSS. His responsibilities are developing a functional website that has our planned features operable. Moreover, he also manages our database locally on his laptop and personal memory drive. Lastly, the task for report of Quan is writing Communication part that he will explain why and how we use certain medias.

                    Our last member finds deep learning intriguing for his future job prospects and useful for our business operated based on data-driven decision-making. Thus, he came up with a project theme that enables subsequent various options for end-users based on artificial intelligence technologies. Unfortunately, due to limited time and our capabilities, our final product is unlikely to implement any of them, but Tin takes part in website development along with Quan and tries to add in ideas of machine learning applications. Overall, he oversees identifying and researching the correlation between our product and users - such as what, when, and why they search for specific ingredients, and where the shop location can meet their expectations. Finally, Tin is the main author of our Topic and Scope in the report where he elaborates our project’s theme as well as features related to our website.

                Because of Covid-19, the eating habits of many consumers across Asia have entirely changed. According to a Nielsen survey, 86 percent of Chinese chose to cook at home post-pandemic instead of eating out, in Hong Kong, the percentage was 77%, in Vietnam, Malaysia, and South Korea, it was 62%, in Thailand it was 56%, and in Taiwan it was 54%. [1]. 
                Due to this change, many people have become accustomed to cooking at home. 
                However, there are numerous factors to consider when cooking, such as ingredients, equipment, and recipes, which can be overwhelming and exhausting. 
                Which is why our project is a food website dedicated to making cooking quick and easy called KookASAP! Our platform, also known as "Cook as soon as possible" is here to assist anyone who needs help in the kitchen. Whether you are an inexperienced cook, short on time, easily confused by recipes, looking to try new dishes, or simply unsure of what to make, KookASAP has something for you. With a range of features including a search function, recipe recommendations, step-by-step instructions, and more, we aim to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly tool to help you find and follow recipes and cook delicious meals. 
                We offer a wide selection of recipes catering to various dietary restrictions and preferences, and our platform also includes features such as ingredient substitutes, recipe scaling, and nutritional information to make cooking even easier. 
                Plus, with integration with meal and grocery delivery services, a social aspect for sharing experiences and connecting with other foodies, and more, KookASAP is here to make cooking enjoyable for everyone.

                However, we believe that our platform offers several unique features that differentiate us from these competitors, which are: 
            </p>
            <p>
                - Missing ingredients shop location: While MyFridgeFood and Supercook allow users to search for recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand; 
                our website takes it a step further by helping users locate and purchase any missing ingredients.
                This feature makes it easier for users to follow recipes and cook delicious meals, even if they don't have all of the necessary ingredients at home. 
                Overall, our website provides a convenient and useful tool for users looking to find and purchase missing ingredients for their recipes. 
            </p>
                <p>
                    - Recipe substitutions: This feature would enable users to enter an ingredient they don't have and locate substitutes for it. 
                    This may be particularly useful for people who are trying to use up ingredients they currently have on hand or for those who must make substitutions because of dietary requirements.        
                </p>
            <p>
                - Recipe scaling: This feature would allow users to adjust the serving size of a recipe up or down to accommodate their needs. 
                This could be especially helpful for those who are cooking for a large group or for those who want to make a recipe in bulk to freeze for later.    
            </p>
            <p>
                - Recipe nutrition information: This feature would allow users to plan their meals for the week and create a shopping list based on their planned meals. 
                This could help users save time and money by planning their meals in advance and only buying the ingredients they need. 
            </p>
            <p>
                - Meal planning calendar: This would involve integrating the website with smart home devices such as smart ovens and refrigerators. 
                This could allow users to easily access and follow recipes while cooking and could also enable the website to suggest recipes based on the ingredients detected in the user's smart refrigerator.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Smart home devices integration: This feature would create a space for users to connect with each other and share cooking tips, recipe ideas, and more. 
                This could help users learn from and engage with other home cooks and could also provide a sense of community and support for those who enjoy cooking.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Community forum: This feature would allow users to input their dietary preferences and the ingredients they have on hand and receive personalized recipe recommendations based on these inputs. 
                This could help users discover new recipes they may not have otherwise considered and make meal planning more efficient.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Recipe recommendations: This feature would allow users to rate and review recipes that they have tried, which could help other users find the best recipes. 
                It could also allow users to leave comments or tips about the recipe, which could be helpful for those who are trying the recipe for the first time.
            </p>
            <p>
                - Recipe ratings and reviews: This feature would allow users to see the nutritional information for a recipe, including the number of calories, fat, protein, and other nutrients. 
                This could be helpful for those who are trying to maintain a healthy diet or who have specific dietary needs.

                                •	Missing ingredients shop location: Once a person logs in, we can assign them with their consent so that we can suggest supermarkets nearby where they can get the ingredients for the recipe they want to make if they do not have the required amount. The user can sign out to cease that action and sign in again when they need to check for their stored recipes if they are unhappy with us keeping track of their online searches. <br>
                                •	Bookmarks: We strongly advise users to register an account since this part was created to make it easier for customers to save their favourite recipes and locate them quickly the next time they visit our website.

                            A concrete plan is undeniably important as the starting point of any project. Hence, our team spent a week making a plan that was suitable for individual schedules and personal skills. However, we have learnt that a project's progress would never be proceeded without any mistakes no matter what scale that project might be, so we have prepared for the worst and been ready to tackle any difficulties according to our risk assessment. But then again, there had been many unexpected outcomes that took us days and nights to remediate the plan. This part will display what we have done to follow the proposal and what changes we have made for our website to work properly. <br>

                                The first phase, or preparation/research phase, is a 5-week period for our team to conduct research on the basics of a project, learn how to build a website, and write a project proposal. <br> <br>
                                Our team divided elements of a project that needed to be studied into sub-parts including Communication and Risks. These tasks were done beautifully; however, we had been enlightened that Scope of a project was the most essential part that it was utterly necessary for us to analyze thoroughly. At first, we mistakened scope as the same as the landscape of a project, but after consulting with our mentor, we decided to include deliverable features and complicated functionalities for both types of scopes – in scope and out of scope, respectively. In addition to changes, the timeframe for our events was also burdensome with three times being revamped. The way we named our events and chose the timeline was completely wrong in the first versions, that made our timetable unclear and hard to follow. Thus, after many meetings, our final timetable became more apparent with reasonable time frames with weekly goals, tasks assignments for each member, and detailed tasks’ descriptions. Consequently, since we had to read more materials related to what we intended, it took us a day or two more to complete our proposal. <br> <br>
                                Another part of this phase was self-learning web developing languages and tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This part was mainly for the developer team to complete in 7 days continuously. It is vital to spend considerable effort in this learning process as our team expected to define web layout and structure with HTML, create pleasant and eye-catching styles for the website using CSS, and build interactive functions such as search engine and integrate with the database, and web APIs utilizing JavaScript. Before starting, we were already overwhelmed with the vast amount of code that came to every detail of a website, but thanks to interactive and user-friendly teaching methods on the w3school website, our team slowly understood basic commands and some complicated functions such as website layout, color matching, searching, and sorting algorithm. In spite of difficulties of learning new languages, we decided to maintain our schedule for this part and proceeded to investigate the concept of a food website via some popular food blogs that have the same theme such as Supercook and MyFridgeFood. <br> <br>
                                Lastly, our team assigned other members to research databases and food APIs through websites. It was not as effortless as it sounded. According to our findings, the most compatible recipe databases paired with cooking APIs cut our budget; hence, our team decided to choose a free version with limited amount of recipe data, at least for our demo version. Next, our team watched many online tutorials and started moving to the exciting second phase – building Kookasap website.

                            <p>
                                In the building phase, our team planned to build the most important features in 5 days, then add some feasible items in the next 3 days. Since everything was going quite smoothly, we were able to include more medium priority components on our website. Moreover, Github repository was where we shared and updated our codes together, but we sometimes made mistakes in commit and push process that took us more time than needed to rewrite or revert the changes.

                                                For our homepage, we have planned to have a layout with the logo in the top left corner, tabs on the top right, and a search bar in the middle with recipes recommendations below it as well as a feedback box at the bottom of the page. We have chosen to use the colors orange, white, and black for the website. In terms of progress, we have succeeded in defining the structure of the page using HTML. However, when it came to styling the page with CSS, we faced some challenges. These included deciding on the font to use, choosing the right color combination, determining the position of each element on the page, and ensuring that the overall design was visually appealing and user-friendly. In order to overcome these issues, we spent a day researching various websites and watching YouTube tutorials to learn more about styling and proportion. Despite the delay, we were able to improve our understanding of these concepts and are now better equipped to create a visually appealing and functional website.

                                                Our plan for the search bar and the search function was to place the search bar in the middle of the page, with the ability to take multiple ingredients as inputs and return corresponding recipes based on themealdb API. We were able to successfully implement the search bar in the desired location. However, when we began working on the search function, we encountered some unexpected issues with handling more than two inputs. Despite spending a day trying to fix the bugs, we were unable to find a reliable solution. As a result, we have decided to temporarily implement the search function with only one input. We will continue to work on resolving the issues with multiple inputs and hope to have a fully functional search function in the future. In the meantime, users will still be able to search for recipes using a single ingredient, which can still be a useful feature for finding recipe ideas and inspiration.

                                        Our original plans for the recipe page included an easy-to-use interface with a clear display of information such as ingredients and step-by-step instructions, authors and publisher, etc. We were able to successfully create a recipe page with basic information including ingredients and instructions, but we were limited by the recipe API in terms of the data we could display which is why the information about the author and publisher were not included inside it. Additionally, we were unable to create a clean and visually appealing layout and design due to limitations in our search functions and data handling as well as our knowledge in design theories. Despite these challenges, we hope to continue improving the recipe page and provide a more user-friendly experience for our users.

                                        The cooking tutorial video that was added to the recipe page was a great success. By providing an interactive button that directs users to the video, we were able to effectively showcase the step-by-step instructions for preparing the dish. The video was well-received and provided a useful resource for those looking to improve their cooking skills. We are pleased with how well the project went according to plan and believe that this addition will greatly benefit our users.

                                        The progress on the sign-in and sign-up feature for the website has been mixed. While we were able to successfully design the basic layouts and implement basic styling using HTML and CSS, we encountered some challenges in terms of creating a functional database to save user information. The reason for this is because we are hosting the website on GitHub pages, which only allows for static pages rather than server-logic or dynamic pages. Another reason for this is because of limitations on our time and knowledge about managing or creating a functional database. As a result, we were unable to create a database to save user information and can only display the basic layout as a demonstration of how this feature would work. While hosting limitations may be a limitation at the moment, we hope to address this issue in the future and continue to improve the user experience on our website.

                                        The plans for the account page is that after clicking the Account Page button, an Account page appears with basic personal information such as name and date of birth as well as security functions such as changing passwords and logging out. We managed to succeed on our end, but there was some problem with Github Page, our host server, so our published website did not work as we intended. Therefore, we needed to spend 1 day more to search for a fix; however, we still faced 405 Error that prevented the user from entering into our website after logging in. At that time, we decided to leave this function as it had been since users could refresh the homepage after login to load the Account page. Surprisingly, through our last fix at the end of the project, this function worked properly.

                                A successful IT project cannot be achieved without testing. However, due to lack of knowledge about quality assurance, we only planned to test our website without a clear direction such as checking typing, input, clickable buttons, etc. 
                                As a consequence, after each test, new bugs could be discovered randomly, which was very irritating. We conducted a quick meeting to categorize test cases based on our research, and finally a more formal list of testing types was constructed. The list consisted of functionality, usability, user interface, compatibility, performance, security, mobile-friendly, and beta testing. Based on the list, it was unnecessary to go through the whole list again whenever there were additional features or bug fixes since they could be categorized into specific types of testing.

                            In any project, the tools and technologies used can greatly impact the success and efficiency of the project. Careful selection and use of the right tools and technologies can streamline workflows, improve collaboration, and lead to higher quality results. For KookASAP, our team used the following software and tools:
                            •	HTML for defining the structure and layout of the website. <br> <br>
                            •	CSS for styling the page and controlling its layout. <br>
                            •	JavaScript for adding interactivity to the page, such as handling the search form submission and modifying the page content based on user actions. <br>
                            •	Github and Github Desktop as well as Git Bash were used for managing and modifying the workflow and project during the development process.
                                These tools were useful in helping to organize and streamline the development process, as they allowed our team to track changes, collaborate, and stay organized as they worked on the project. <br>
                            •	Photoshop version 23.5.0 was used to design the logo for the project, In order to use Photoshop, a license was required. This allowed our team to legally access and use the software for their project. The use of Photoshop allowed our team to create a high-quality logo that helped to establish the branding and visual identity of the project. <br> <br>
                                The only hardware requirement was a standard laptop or similar devices. <br> <br>
                                Regarding prior experience, all group members had experience with Github, Github Desktop and Git Bash. Tin and Quan had experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our member, Tin, only had 1 month experience with Photoshop, so he learned it specifically for this project. Overall, our team was able to utilize our skills and knowledge to successfully complete the project.

                            Communication is a key to easily make a decision in our project. Communication will give us new ideas or new perspectives from people in our group based on their experiences or their research with their personal views. Furthermore, each person can give their opinions about the current ideas in order to decide which one will be kept for the project. [3] <br> <br>
                            At the beginning of our project, we were already unanimous in communication. We both use online and offline meetings so that we can have a variable way of communication.

                                        We prefer to use apps to communicate such as Messenger or Microsoft Teams if we are busy or cannot make an appointment. It is easier to talk with each other online so that we can save time and solve problems immediately. <br>
                                        We chat via Messenger to ask about the progress of our project or choose a suitable time for everyone to make a face-to-face meeting. Word and One drive are selected for us to share and update documents and manage the progress of our project. We use Microsoft Teams if we need to solve a sudden problem that can not be done by using text.

                                        We will choose a face-to-face meeting for important things about the project (I.e., topic, idea, or research) because it helps us to communicate, and hear other's opinions to choose the best solution for the project. We have a face-to-face meeting once a week and the duration of the meeting is around 2-3 hours, depending on what we discuss about (i.e. topic, role, ideas, or time for the next session). We also can have unexpected meetings for the project’s progress in just about 15-30 minutes if we are available at that time. <br>
                                        We will increase the face-to-face meeting to twice a week or have some meetings after classes so that we can discuss our project. If there is any conflict, we will immediately have a face-to-face meeting in order to communicate with each other so that we can lead to a solution.

                                        Most project groups will have conflicts which can collapse your team morale. We have already prepared carefully for those troubles some useful solutions. For instance, if we have many different opinions, we will organize a meeting to discuss them with each other and then members in our group will decide which opinion is better and get a good mark. Moreover, if we cannot contact other members in the group while doing a project, we will find and meet them after the tutorial lesson to find out the reasons for their absences. On top of that, we will mail or converse directly to the course coordinator to announce them if we cannot find them on campus. <br>
                                        We respect each member’s time so we expect the person in our team to respond after 24 hours or more if he has any problem. However, we will try to catch them on campus to ask them if there is any issue or reason why they did not respond. In addition, if we can not find them on campus or there is no way we can contact them after 1 day, we will need to meet the rest of the group to decide what will we do next without them or contact our teacher to announce the situation our group are facing so that the teacher can give us a solution or suggestion for our issue.

                            Risks encounters are inevitable in any kind of project; therefore, risks assessment should be carried out carefully and discussed thoroughly among project key members. D. Lock stated in [] that poor risk management could result in a wide range of consequences from negligible effects to devastating outcomes. Being aware of the possible failure, we made a list of potential effects (S) of risks based on their chances of occurrence (P) and ranked them from 1 to 3, meaning the lowest point to the highest point in both scales respectively. Afterall, the ranking point, which will be in range from 1 to 9, will take the multiplication of those 2, being the main contributor to our decisions towards mitigating or avoiding actions. <br> <br>
                            After our first meeting, we concluded that there are three main risk categories involving technicality, end-user, and personal matters. In each part, some risks that we have discussed will be ranked accordingly and followed by a brief description as well as preventive methods or reactionary actions.

                                        A technical fault involves our website performance and quality of maintenance. Most of them should have a low score since we are deeply concerned about the integrity of our products, so we have made numerous concrete preventive plans to deal with any issues. <br> <br>
                                        <b>The workload of the website is lower than expected (P x S = 3 x 2 = 6)</b> <br>
                                        Currently we plan to allow 100 users at a time to access our website. If this number drops below 100 for a week, we will review our code together and update our workflow so that the capacity reaches our goal value. There will be no expense involved in this matter. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Internet issue – slow (P x S = 2 x 1 = 2)</b> <br> 
                                        If this event occurs, our first course of action is to review the workload in our pipeline. Should no issue be found, we will immediately contact our internet provider or tools provider to discuss further. There will be no expense involved in this matter. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Internet issue – shutdown (P x S = 1 x 3 = 3)</b> <br>
                                        If this event occurs, we will check on our end if we send the package properly. Should no issue be found, we will immediately contact our internet provider or tools provider to discuss further. There will be no expense involved in this matter. However, if the shutdown might take longer than 1 day, we will look for an alternative, such as reducing logins and using backup version.
                                        After the event ends, we will send an apology pop-up and email to our users. For our partners, we will have a meeting with them to discuss if they need compensation. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Broken computers (P x S = 1 x 3 = 3)</b> <br>
                                        This event can be resulted from many reasons such as lousy maintenance, outdated or incompatible components, flying objects, etc. If this event occurs, we will form a technical team to fix the computers; otherwise, we will purchase a new one within acceptable expenditures. During this time, we will use another computer and reduce the dataflow to keep the website running at lower capacity.  <br>
                                        For our partners, we will have a meeting with them to discuss if they need compensation. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Corrupted files (P x S = 1 x 2 = 2)</b> <br>
                                        If this event occurs, we will send our technical team to investigate the files and decide if we should delete or fix and recover them. In case this file stops our business operation, we will either use our backup version or temporarily suspend unnecessary but involving sections until this issue is completely fixed. We rank the severity of this event as 2 because most corrupted files are recoverable and revisable.

                                        This type of risk is foreseeable in most cases, but their effects are sometimes unpredictable. Nonetheless, we will try our best to solve and avoid these unfortunate events. <br><br>
                                        <b>Partner gives wrong information (P x S = 1 x 3 = 3)</b> <br>
                                        This event is hard to detect before the website initiation. However, if this event occurs, we will immediately withdraw all sales, information details of the partner and form a team to solve refund issues with the users who have done business with that partner through us. If our analysis team confirms that the wrong information is not deceitful, we will arrange a meeting with that party to discuss and enhance our terms in contracts.  <br> <br>
                                        <b>Partner updates their shops information late (P x S = 1 x 2 = 2)</b> <br>
                                        If this event occurs, we will temporarily disable the items and contact our partner to update their sales details immediately. To prevent this event from happening, we will send emails to remind them to update the items 1 day before. This will be one of the terms in our contracts.  <br> <br>
                                        <b>Users intentionally scam others using our websites (P x S = 2 x 2 = 4) </b> <br>
                                        If this event occurs, we will compensate the victims fairly and work with the police to apprehend the fraud. As a prevention method, we will keep inspecting our features and updating scam strategy to our users publicly.  <br> <br>
                                        <b>We give wrong information (P x S = 1 x 3 = 3)</b> <br>
                                        If this event occurs, we will actively and immediately contact our partner to discuss settlement. Otherwise, we will be willing to compensate.  
                                        For our users, we will issue refunds for those involved and discuss with our project management implementing a refreshing event on our website. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Our website does not suggest the most optimal way (P x S = 2 x 3 = 6)</b> <br>
                                        If this event occurs, we will review our code internally as well as improving our algorithm to meet the users’ expectations.

                                        We will let the person rest within the duration of the sick leave prescribed by a certified doctor or our appointed clinics.  Other members will work with each other to maintain our operation. Should the spot be crucial, we will discuss if some lighter tasks can be delayed, or someone can work overtime to fulfill the important tasks. <br> <br>
                                        <b>Accidents (P x S = 1 x 3 = 3)</b> <br>
                                        Since the recovery duration might take months, we will look for a recruit or another party to take care of the job. The recruit will be offered the chance to stay if they display outstanding performance.

                                        In case of catastrophic circumstances - such as flooding, earthquakes, or any natural disasters, we will create 2 backup versions that will be stored and only accessible by 1 key member and the project manager. Moreover, monthly, we will discuss internal and external behaviors if this case ever occurs. The objective here is to let our key members be aware of not only their emotions, which tend to be devastated at that point, but also the reasons for others’ intrusive and dreadful thoughts during the disaster.

                            Testing our website is the crucial step to ensure that the website has no problems before we present it to everyone. Firstly, we accessed the website and logged in with a guest account. After the login was complete, we took a try at identifying ingredients through the search engine on the homepage. When we entered the ingredients that we want to cook with the food, the recommendation showed all French cuisine recipe which includes our chosen ingredients. Unfortunately, the leader of our group recognized a bug in the bookmark extension and reported it to the team. The issue is the users are not able to save their loving recipes and it will take a long time to research them again. We maintenanced the website for a while and fixed the bug. It was not a serious problem, but we will get in trouble with our distinguished guests in the future if they cannot save their own recipes at favorite. <br> <br>
                            During the second testing time, we invited a few students in the school to be users of our website. Our purpose is to know the opinion of other users except the developers. Luckily, we received many positive comments on our project. The users told us that they could access the website immediately without any problems. They were surprised when we told them that the website was hosted on Github which solves all issues of internet connection. Finally, thanks to the user's opinion, we are now extremely confident and optimistic when we introduce the project to the class.

                                    We also did the double check to confirm that links that point to the same page are not present and there aren't any faulty links. <br> <br>
                                •<b>Forms testing:</b> For interactive communication with our users, we employ forms. 
                                    Therefore, we checked the valid input data set, the invalid data field input values and the options for forms when it is feasible to delete or modify data in any other way. <br> <br>

                                    To check the cookies, we tried a website with cookies turned off and turned on. Secondly, before writing the cookie to the user's computer, we make sure it is encrypted. 
                                    On top of that, if the cookies have a set amount of time for their action, their continued activation is checked. <br> <br>

                                    We also checked that the site's color scheme, text sizes are optimized, and accurate information is provided in the instructions. <br> <br>
                                •<b>UI testing:</b> Experimenting with various screen resolutions, testing of localized versions includes testing the length of interface element names and the correctness of translation (multilingual), testing the graphical user interface on the intended mobile and tablet platforms. <br> <br>
                                •<b>Performance testing:</b> Testing how the site behaves as the workload increases, determining whether it can work inside or slightly above the permissible timeframe. Performance evaluation of a website with many users logged in. <br> <br>
                                •<b>Security testing:</b> We did some verification for security. We checked that sessions are terminated automatically when a user is inactive for a lengthy time and tested SSL encryption features. To ensure that the website will not have any problems with security, we also utilized SQL MAP for the security testing. <br> <br>
                                •<b>Mobile-friendly testing:</b> To be guaranteed that users can access our website by mobile phone, we did some testing on the mobile. We improved the speed at which your website loads and the size of each image. <br> <br>

                        -	These functionalities can help solve the problem of not knowing what to cook or how to cook a particular dish. By providing a search bar and recipe recommendations based on inputted ingredients, the website helps users find meal ideas that they can make with ingredients they already have or can easily obtain. The detailed recipe pages and step-by-step cooking videos make it easy for users to follow along and successfully prepare the dish. This can save time and effort for users who may otherwise spend a lot of time trying to find and plan meals or who may feel uncertain about their cooking skills. Overall, these functionalities can make the process of finding and cooking meals more convenient and efficient for users. <br> <br>
                        -	While the website is fully functional and users can start using it right away, it is still in a very early stage of development. This means that it still lacking some features or have some rough edges that will be improved upon in future updates. Despite this, the website is still useful for finding and accessing recipes and can help users plan and prepare meals more efficiently. It is always possible that there may be some bugs or issues that arise while using the website, but the development team is committed to addressing any problems and continuously improving the website's functionality.

                    <b id="Limitations and Known Bugs">Limitations and Known Bugs</b>
                    <p>
                        There are a few known bugs and limitations of the system that users should be aware of: <br> <br>
                        -	Some special cases with more than 2 ingredients may result in the website returning recipes that are unrelated to the inputted ingredients. For this issue, our development team may need to improve the search algorithm or add additional filters to better match the inputted ingredients to relevant recipes. <br> <br>
                        -	The website's interface may not look as pleasing on smaller screens or resolutions. To address this, our designing team may need to adjust the layout or design of the website to better adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. <br> <br>
                        -	The recipe APIs database used by the website is limited, which means that the number of available recipes is restricted. Our development team is working on expanding the database and integrating additional APIs or source recipes from other sources. <br> <br>
                        -	The recipe pages are still not very detailed and have a limited amount of information available. Additionally, they may not look as clean and polished as desired. To make the recipe pages more detailed and clean-looking, our development team may need to add more information to the pages and improve the design and layout. This could involve adding additional photos, nutritional information, tips, or other details to the pages.
                        -	The login, sign up, and account pages are being displayed as interfaces for demo purposes due to limitations in our knowledge about user databases and how to handle them. While these features are important for providing a smooth and secure user experience, we are unable to implement them at this time due to these limitations. In order to address the limitations in our knowledge about user databases and how to handle them, we are committed to continuing our education and training in this area. We are constantly seeking out new resources and opportunities to improve our understanding and skills in this field, and we are dedicated to finding ways to overcome these limitations. While we recognize that this may take time, we are confident that with dedication and hard work, we will be able to overcome these limitations and fully implement the login, sign up, and account pages in the future. <br> <br>
                        -	In addition to the login, sign up, and account pages, it is also important to note that the community forum is being displayed as a layout only due to our limitations in knowledge about user databases and how to handle them. While we believe that a community forum can be a valuable resource for users to connect with each other and share their experiences, we are unable to implement this feature at this time due to our current limitations. We are actively working to improve our knowledge and capabilities in this area so that we can fully implement the community forum in the future. <br> <br>
                        -	A fixed bug but worth mentioning: Error 405 when the user tried to press the login or sign up button after filled in their informations, this is due to the limitation when hosting the website using github Page since they only allow us to host static website, this means that the content of our website is served directly to users and cannot be dynamically generated or changed based on user input or server-side logic. Although we are working hard to develop and improve our website, we may be limited by time constraints and may not be able to implement certain features or hosting solutions at this time. For example, hosting a dynamic website on a server that allows POST requests or using a different method for sending data to the server such as AJAX may require a significant time investment to set up and maintain. In the meantime, we can continue to host our website on GitHub pages and make use of the available features and limitations to the best of our ability. While GitHub pages may not support all of the functionality that we would like to include on our website, it can still serve as a valuable platform for hosting and sharing our content with users. <br> <br>
                        Overall, while the website is functional and can be useful for finding and accessing recipes, it is still in an early stage of development and may have some bugs or limitations. The specific solutions that are implemented will depend on the resources and priorities of our team.

Some areas that could potentially be improved upon in the future include expanding the recipe database to include more diverse and international dishes, adding additional features such as a meal planner or shopping list, and integrating with other platforms or apps to provide a more seamless experience for users, etc. The team is also working on improving the website's performance and addressing any remaining bugs or issues that may arise. Overall, there are many ways that the website could be further improved to provide a better experience for users.

                            The task of testing a website's functionality falls on website testers. To imitate actual user behavior, such as moving across multiple sites or interacting with different page elements, they frequently employ several tools and techniques. The task of finding any flaws or problems that are discovered by website testers may also be given to them. This may entail making thorough notes about what occurred and how it occurred so that programmers may subsequently figure out and resolve the issue.
